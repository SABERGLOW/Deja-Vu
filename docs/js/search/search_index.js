with Angular CLI version 13. The core function of this application is to detect, recognize and analyze human faces by uploading images to the web application with the help of Micrsoft's Face API; An AI service that analyzes faces in images. Face API's features include face detection that perceives facial features and attributes—such as a face mask, glasses, or face location—in an image, and identification of a person by a match to your private repository or via photo ID.\n\nTech Stack\nThe application is built using following technologies:\n\nAngular 13\nMDB (Material Design for Bootstrap 5 & Angular 13)\nFace API\nCompodoc\n\n\nDevelopment server\nRun ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nBuild\nRun ng build to build the project.
