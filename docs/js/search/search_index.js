with Angular CLI version 13. The core function of this application is to detect, recognize and analyze human faces by uploading images to the web application with the help of Micrsoft's Face API; An AI service that analyzes faces in images. Face API's features include face detection that perceives facial features and attributes—such as a face mask, glasses, or face location—in an image, and identification of a person by a match to your private repository or via photo ID.\n\nFeatures and Capabilities\nThe application is capable of following functionalities, with room for improvement:\n\nDetect: Facial features and attributes of a single person can be detected by uploading an image.\nTrain: A Person Group can be creaeted, withinn which, a Person can be created and his/her images can be trained.\nIdentify: A person can be identified from a pre-existing and pre-trained Person Group.\n\nFor more detail, please refer to Azure Face API documentation.\nPRs and Contributions are welcome.\n\nTech Stack\nThe application is built using following technologies:\n\nAngular 13\nMDB (Material Design for Bootstrap 5 & Angular 13)\nFace API\nCompodoc\n\n\nProject Structure\nA general overlay of Project Structure and it's components and assets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment server\nRun ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nBuild\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory.\n\nDocumentation \nDeveloper Documentation is available through compodoc. The documentation website can be served locally by running npm run compodoc, and is accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8080.\n\nSample Face Attrbutes Response\n[\n  {\n    \"faceId\": \"49d55c17-e018-4a42-ba7b-8cbbdfae7c6f\",\n    \"faceRectangle\": {\n      \"top\": 131,\n      \"left\": 177,\n      \"width\": 162,\n      \"height\": 162\n    },\n    \"faceAttributes\": {\n      \"smile\": 0,\n      \"headPose\": {\n        \"pitch\": 0,\n        \"roll\": 0.1,\n        \"yaw\": -32.9\n      },\n      \"gender\": \"female\",\n      \"age\": 22.9,\n      \"facialHair\": {\n        \"moustache\": 0,\n        \"beard\": 0,\n        \"sideburns\": 0\n      },\n      \"glasses\": \"NoGlasses\",\n      \"emotion\": {\n        \"anger\": 0,\n        \"contempt\": 0,\n        \"disgust\": 0,\n        \"fear\": 0,\n        \"happiness\": 0,\n        \"neutral\": 0.986,\n        \"sadness\": 0.009,\n        \"surprise\": 0.005\n      },\n      \"blur\": {\n        \"blurLevel\": \"low\",\n        \"value\": 0.06\n      },\n      \"exposure\": {\n        \"exposureLevel\": \"goodExposure\",\n        \"value\": 0.67\n      },\n      \"noise\": {\n        \"noiseLevel\": \"low\",\n        \"value\": 0\n      },\n      \"makeup\": {\n        \"eyeMakeup\": true,\n        \"lipMakeup\": true\n      },\n      \"accessories\": [],\n      \"occlusion\": {\n        \"foreheadOccluded\": false,\n        \"eyeOccluded\": false,\n        \"mouthOccluded\": false\n      },\n      \"hair\": {\n        \"bald\": 0,\n        \"invisible\": false,\n        \"hairColor\": [\n          {\n            \"color\": \"brown\",\n            \"confidence\": 1\n          },\n          {\n            \"color\": \"black\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.87\n          },\n          {\n            \"color\": \"other\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.51\n          },\n          {\n            \"color\": \"blond\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.08\n          },\n          {\n            \"color\": \"red\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.08\n          },\n          {\n            \"color\": \"gray\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.02\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2022 Wali Ullah\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
